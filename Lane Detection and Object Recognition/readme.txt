Project description -
This project focuses on developing a robust driving assistance system by combining classical computer vision techniques (Canny Edge Detection and Hough Transforms) for lane detection and deep learning-based object recognition (YOLOv8n). The goal is to enhance overall performance, address current challenges, and contribute to safer autonomous driving.
